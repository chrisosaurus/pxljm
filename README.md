A game written for pxljm 2011; pxljm is a 48 hours game making competition where all code and assets
must be made on site and within that window.

This is a space-themed resource acquisition and control game.

We didn't have an artist so you instead get our glorious programmer art: triangles for ships and
circles for planets!
